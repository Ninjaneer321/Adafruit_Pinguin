# Adafruit_Pinguin
An EAGLE silkscreen label generator allowing nicer fonts, because EAGLE's
proportional font doesn't get output in CAM data, and the new vector font
isn't very attractive.

Inspired somewhat by SparkFun's "Buzzard" project, but wanting something
more automated.

Name is a crappy portmanteau of "pin" (because that's mostly what's getting
labeled) and "penguin" (keeping with the bird naming motif; EAGLE, Buzzard,
etc.).

At the moment this is just a few sloppy Python test scripts. It will get
cleaned up into some kind of proper usable tool(s).

"fonts" folder contains GNU FreeFont files as a starting point.
